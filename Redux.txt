What is Redux?
- When a JS application grows big, it becomes difficult for the user to manage its state.
- Redux solves this problem by managing application's state with a single global object, called store.
- Makes Testing very easy.
- Consistency throughout this application.


ACTIONS AND REDUCERS:
- An action is a plain object that describes the intention to cause change.
- A reducer is a function that determines changes to an application's state. Return the new state and tell the store how to do.
- It uses the action it receives to determine this change.
